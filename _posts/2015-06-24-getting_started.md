My very first project is making this website on [github](https://github.com). Over the past few months, I've been working on building my programming skills and as I begin to apply those new skills to projects, I am looking forward to having a space to document my progress.

The process may be a bit slow, as this is all a side project, but I am excited to see how much I can learn over the next few months!
